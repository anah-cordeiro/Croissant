    <h1>More About the Pastry</h1>
    <ul>
      <strong>Curiosities about the pastry:</strong>
      <li>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
        shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
        laminated dough.
      </li>
      <li>Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.</li>
      <li>
        The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
        succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Laminating results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff
        pastry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
        crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian cuisine, and are often
        found in French bakeries and p√¢tisseries.
      </li>
      <li>
        The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French
        bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened
        laminated dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European
        countries and served as dessert all around the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French
        response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30-40% of the
        croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from
        frozen dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed
        but unbaked dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked
        by unskilled labor.
      </li>
    </ul>
